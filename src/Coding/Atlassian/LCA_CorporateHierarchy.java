 * You are given a company's organizational hierarchy represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
 * The company has a root node 'Company', which branches into multiple departments.
 * Each department contains multiple employees. You are given a list of employee IDs.
 * Your task is to find the department that is the 'closest' common department to all the given employees.
 * 'Closest' means the lowest common ancestor (LCA) department in the hierarchy graph.
 * If any employee ID is invalid (does not exist in the company), return null.
 * If no common department is found, return null
