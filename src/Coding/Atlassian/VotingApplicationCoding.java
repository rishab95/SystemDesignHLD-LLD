/**
 * Can anyone help me with this question.
 *
 * Given a list of votes for the candidates
 * {c1, c2, c1, c2, c1, c2, c3 ,c4, c4}
 * we need to determine the winner based on the total number of votes for each candidate.
 *
 * Question:
 *
 * In case of tie, what are all the different stategies we can follow?
 * Which among the suggested strategy is the best ? I googled and read that weighted strategy is a
 * suitable one, but need help me with its implementation.
 * Sample solution that GPT provided when asked for weighted strategy. Here,
 * between c1 and c2, if c2 received first vote later, c2 is considered as winner.
 * (Not sure if this is the right approach)
